## Projects and deliverables (corporate context)

Most of my career has been in **private companies and products**, so the repositories I’ve built are not public. In short, I’ve worked on:

- **Product platforms** — new features, scalability, alignment with product strategy
- **E-commerce at scale** — migration to microservices, serverless, improved deployment and modularity
- **APIs and integrations** — Java and Python backends for multiple clients and platforms
- **Infrastructure and DevOps** — CI/CD pipelines, containers, cloud (AWS/GCP), Linux production environments
- **Volunteer education** — since 2020, teaching technology (programming logic and hardware) on NGOs projects
